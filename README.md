Aero is a project that focuses on two areas that we've seen done poorly in other bots time and time again:
- Moderation
- User Engagement

Aero's goal is to make advanced moderation and anti-raid as simple and intuitive to use as possible, without sacrificing any of the features seen in competing bots.
If you're already using a bot like Dyno, Carl, Mee6, or any of the other popular multiuse bots, there's a good chance Aero can completely replace them, protecting you and your members more efficiently from raids, spam, or just known baddies.
